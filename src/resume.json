		"summary": "Over the past 8 years I have frequently challenged myself with new languages, frameworks and methodologies. My core language has always been javascript but not limitied to it. I had also worked as a Python, Java, Android & iOS developer building games, user interfaces, backend & business applications for various devices and formfactors. In my current role I am working as Fullstack developer and cloud consultant, working on a ReactJS Business application. I have a very strong interest in full stack javascript development and have recently been doing the same from a couple of years. I have experience using build tools such as Grunt & webpack. I also belive in Test Based developement and I invest good amount of time in automating every aspects of testing including unit, end to end & Gui tesing to name a few. In my most recent roles I have been exposed to enterprise Agile development and received training in live projects.",
